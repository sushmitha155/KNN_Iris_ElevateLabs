# 🌼 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification - Iris Dataset

## 📌 Internship Task 6 - Elevate Labs

This project demonstrates how to use the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification on the Iris dataset.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🧪 Steps Performed

- Loaded and explored the Iris dataset
- Normalized features using `StandardScaler`
- Trained KNN classifiers with K values from 1 to 10
- Evaluated accuracy and visualized confusion matrix
- Plotted decision boundaries for 2D visualization

## 🔍 Observations

- Best accuracy achieved at K=3
- Confusion matrix showed high accuracy with little misclassification
- Normalization was critical for correct distance calculation
